# default_app
a skeleton application of sorts, that is meant to be a base for an application. Use to see what you may need on a full stack application and add to it what is unique to you.
# Ex: Could be in bootstrap as UI but can figure out how to use FluentUI. 
# Ex: Could be a landing page, but also a page that connects to a database or could use a json file as the data to map onto the page.
# Ex: Could be a way to try an older or newer version of something (sandbox-esqe), where you have the general setup completed for yourself to get going.
